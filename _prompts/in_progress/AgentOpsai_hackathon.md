ABOUT THE CHALLENGE:
GPT store came out -- time to build. We got tired of half-finished hackathon projects, so there's a special challenge this time: first one to get an actual, real-life paying customer wins. :)


All online this time -- head to https://arena.x-ware.online to check out the discord where the event will take place.

P.S. Expect a live, open-source version to build on when the event kicks off, or create a GPT using OpenAI's new interface.


REQUIREMENTS
WHAT TO BUILD
GPTs! Cool ones, weird ones, ones that probably shouldn't work but do anyway.
OSS stuff that relates to GPTs/gpt store infra/marketplaces,

WHAT TO SUBMIT
Code (If Applicable)
Links to your GPT (preferably functional, but if not at least a pretty good idea of where you were headed)
30-90s video in case we need to async-judge you. Does not need to be Hollywood, can be scrappy. 
PRIZES
$1,880 in prizes
 AirPods - Best use of AgentOps SDK
Regular Airpods & 1:1 AgentOps Support

The AI agent market is expected to grow to $28.5B by 2028, but there is currently no way to test where agents are succeeding and failing. For example, an agent may succeed at writing an investor memo, but it may fail at sourcing where its information came from. Agents require specialized tooling due to the way they perform functions autonomously, and developers need to understand the compliance, reliability, and robustness of their agents to bring them to market.

To tackle this problem, we built the AgentOps SDK and testing platform as well as our agent marketplace at Staf.ai.
