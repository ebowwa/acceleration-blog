The recent discourse on social media platforms regarding the future of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) and their potential path towards a plug-in store model has sparked numerous conversations among developers, tech enthusiasts, and AI ethicists alike.

## The Current State: GPTs and Plug-ins

The concept of a plug-in store for AI models like GPTs isn't new. It was introduced with much enthusiasm, envisaged as a marketplace where developers could host custom functions to enhance their AI interactions. Major tech integration platforms, including the likes of Zapier, showed interest. The appeal was undeniable, but it also presented a barrier for those new to coding or AI.

## The Challenge of Accessibility

Despite the excitement, the uptake was slow. A significant contributing factor to this was the level of expertise required to leverage these tools effectively. Those with coding experience, connections in tech hubs like the San Francisco Bay Area, or an active presence on platforms like Twitter, had an advantage. But what about those who were not in these circles?

## The Shift: Towards AGI

As attention waned from plug-ins, it shifted to the GPT store and custom hosted GPTs by OpenAI in November 2023. The narrative pivoted to the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)â€”an AI capable of human-like understanding and learning. The progression towards AGI suggests a future where the need for specialized AI models may diminish, leading to a more homogenized AI market.

## The Intellectual Property Debate

A point of contention is the protection of intellectual property within the realm of GPT prompts and outputs. Some argue for the open nature of AI development, while others are concerned about the potential for a market flooded with derivative and low-quality AI tools.

## Grimoire: A Glimpse into Creative Coding

A standout example is the 'Grimoire' by MindGoblin Studios, a platform that showcases the integration of AI with web development. It's a glimpse into a future where AI could democratize complex tasks like coding, making it accessible to a broader audience.

The dialogues surrounding the evolution of GPTs, plug-in models, and the road to AGI represent a microcosm of the broader discussions about AI's role in our future. These discussions challenge our understanding of creativity, ownership, and democratization in the age of AI.

As we navigate this uncharted territory, it remains crucial to engage in these conversations, ensuring that the advancement of AI aligns with ethical standards and serves the greater good.
