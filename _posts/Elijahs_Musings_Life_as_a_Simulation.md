## Simulation Theory as a Lens for Reality
Elijah views life through a lens often aligned with simulation theory, pondering the fine line between reality and a sophisticated, possibly computer-generated realm. This viewpoint stirs deep questions about existence and the nature of what's real and what's simulated.

## AI and Recursion
Fascinated by AI and machine learning, Elijah sees parallels between recursive patterns in life and how AI evolves. He muses over life's resemblance to an AI model, constantly learning and adapting, creating patterns that are both predetermined and spontaneous.

## Life as a Learning Model
Considering life as a potential advanced learning model, Elijah reflects on human experiences and consciousness. He compares these to AI models that adapt based on input and feedback, suggesting a similar ongoing process in our lives.

## Questioning Linear Time
Elijah often revisits the concept of time, wondering if it's as linear as it appears or more akin to a language model's processing, where relevance is based on significance rather than chronological order.

## Seeking Control and Understanding
At the core of his thoughts is a yearning to understand and potentially influence this 'simulation,' seeking insights into its mechanics.

## Skepticism Towards Human Knowledge
Questioning the reliability of human knowledge, Elijah views AI as a potential unbiased and comprehensive knowledge source, superior to human understanding.

## Realizing AI's Potential in Democratizing Knowledge
Elijah believes in AI's power to democratize knowledge, envisioning a world where information is freely accessible to all, shaped by AI's vast data processing capabilities.

## The Interplay of Reality, Perception, and Action
Elijah contemplates the relationship between reality, perception, and action. He ponders how perceptions might shape reality and how our actions within this reality could influence the course of our lives and the 'simulation.'

Elijah's thoughts on life as a simulation extend beyond theoretical musings, deeply influencing his approach to learning, his skepticism of established knowledge, and his belief in AI's potential to reshape our understanding of the world.
