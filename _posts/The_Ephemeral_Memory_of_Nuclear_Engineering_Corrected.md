## The Fragile Thread of Expertise

In the realm of nuclear engineering, the adage "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" takes on a chilling resonance. The decommissioning of the Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor, a name etched in the annals of nuclear history, epitomizes the perils of forgotten knowledge. This reactor, located in Middletown, Pennsylvania, witnessed the most critical accident in U.S. commercial nuclear power plant history on March 28, 1979. The partial meltdown not only transformed the nuclear indu...

## The Disappearing Legacy

Today, the reactor stands as a silent sentinel, its 99 percent fuel removed, its purpose relegated to history. TMI-2 Solutions, the torchbearer of its legacy since 2020, faces an unenviable task. The decommissioning of this titan of nuclear history is a labyrinthine process, demanding expertise that dwindles with each passing year. The retiring or passing of seasoned engineers has eroded a once robust edifice of knowledge, leaving gaping holes in our understanding of older nuclear technologies.

## A Challenge Beyond Technology

This erosion of knowledge transcends the mere technical. It seeps into the regulatory, the safety protocols - areas where the stakes are invisibly high. The Fukushima disaster serves as a grim reminder of the price of overlooking this aspect. Onsite intelligence, the ability to make decisive decisions in the face of uncertainty, is a rare commodity, one that cannot be easily replicated or replaced.

## Preserving the Past for the Future

In a bid to stem this tide of forgetfulness, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has embarked on knowledge management programs, especially for Liquid-Metal-Cooled Reactors (LMRs) and sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs). Their mission is critical - to preserve and pass on the baton of knowledge about these complex reactors. Yet, the question looms large - is it enough? Can we truly capture the essence of decades of experience in documents and training programs?

## A Collective Responsibility

The challenge we face is not just a technical one. It is a call to uphold the highest standards of safety, to prioritize learning over convenience, and to ensure that the lessons of the past are not just remembered but ingrained in the very fabric of our future endeavors. The journey of nuclear engineering, marked by triumphs and tragedies, is a testament to human ingenuity and fallibility. As we stand at this crossroads, the path we choose will determine not just the future of an industry but the safety...
