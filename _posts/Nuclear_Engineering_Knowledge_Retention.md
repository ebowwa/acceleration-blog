The evolving landscape of nuclear engineering in the United States paints a concerning picture of knowledge retention and transfer across generations. The decommissioning of the Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor, a significant event in U.S. nuclear history, brings this issue to the forefront. The meltdown that occurred on March 28, 1979, marked a pivotal moment, leading to drastic changes in the industry and regulatory measures by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Fast forward to the present day, the reactor stands permanently shut down, with the decommissioning process underway by TMI-2 Solutions. But this task is far from straightforward.

A fundamental challenge in this process is the loss of institutional knowledge. With the retirement or passing of seasoned engineers, invaluable experience and expertise have dwindled. This gap presents a stark difficulty in managing older nuclear technologies, which are intricate and demand specific know-how. Reports from the industry have highlighted the daunting task of building the next generation of power plants, citing the loss of earlier experience and resources as a major hurdle.

Beyond the technical realm, this knowledge loss extends to regulatory and safety aspects. The Fukushima nuclear incident, for instance, emphasized the crucial role of onsite intelligence, decision-making capabilities, and the overarching priority of safety in plant operations. These lessons underscore the pressing need for robust knowledge management strategies, not only to preserve technical know-how but also to maintain high safety standards.

In response, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has initiated knowledge management programs, especially for Liquid-Metal-Cooled Reactors (LMRs) and sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs). These initiatives aim to safeguard and pass on critical knowledge about these reactor types. Yet, the challenge remains immense, raising questions about our capacity to retain and transfer complex, specialized knowledge across generations in the nuclear field. As the industry evolves, it becomes increasingly vital to address these concerns, ensuring that the legacy of past experiences shapes a safer, more efficient future in nuclear engineering.
